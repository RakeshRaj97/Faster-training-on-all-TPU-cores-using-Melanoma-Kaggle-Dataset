This repository contains code for the ongoing Kaggle Competition SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification.

The main aim of this repository is to provide a highly reusable and easily customizable code which provides an AUC ROC score of 0.90+


[data source] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification)

[current code] (https://www.kaggle.com/rocky03/effnet-pytorch-tpu) Note: I will release the fully functional code once the competition ends. One can use this as a reference to understand how to speed up the training using all TPU cores at once!

Since it's an ongoing live competition, additional ensembling and other techniques will be released once the competition ends.
