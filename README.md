This repository contains code for the ongoing Kaggle Competition SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification.

The main aim of this repository is to provide a highly reusable and easily customizable code which provides an AUC ROC score of 0.90+

This idea is experimental. One can use this as a reference to understand how to speed up the training using all TPU cores at once!
